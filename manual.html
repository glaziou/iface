DESCRIPTION</A>
</H2>

<P>
<I>S</I>ampsize computes sample size and power for prevalence studies, sample
size and power for one-sample and two-sample comparative studies of percentages
and means, and for unmatched and 1:1 matched case-control studies. 

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00025000000000000000">
USAGE</A>
</H2>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><B>Prevalence Surveys</B></STRONG></DT>
<DD>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The following options are relevant to simple prevalence studies:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>-e</STRONG></DT>
<DD>precision (%): we wish to obtain confidence limits equal to prevalence +/- precision
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>-pr</STRONG></DT>
<DD>prevalence (%), default 50%
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>-pop</STRONG></DT>
<DD>target population size, default 0 (infinite)
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>-level</STRONG></DT>
<DD>of confidence interval, default 95%
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The population size is the total size of the population from which a
sample will be drawn for a prevalence survey. If the population size
is small, the correction for finite population will result in a
reduced sample size. A prevalence study will need either the <B>-e</B>
option for precision, or the <B>-nob</B> option to specify a finite
number of events (see below).

<P>
Entering 50 (50%) for the estimated prevalence (<B>-pr 50</B>), which
is the default value, will result in the highest estimated sample
size.  Entering 0 for the population size (<B>-pop 0</B>) will result
in the programme using an infinite population size.  If a null
prevalence is entered ( <B>-pr 0</B>), <I>s</I>ampsize returns the
estimated sample size needed for a 95% (default) confidence interval
upper limit that is equal to the entered precision (option <B>-e</B>).
Any other confidence interval may be selected instead of the 95%
confidence interval, using the option <B>-level</B>. <I>S</I>ampsize
will display the binomial exact confidence interval using the returned
sample size unless a finite population size is specified. It may
happen that this exact interval is larger than the expected interval
(prevalence plus or minus precision), when the number of successful
events is lower than 5, or when sample size minus that number is lower
than 5, due to the lack of precision of the normal approximation
formula with small numbers. In thoses instances, it is advisable to
test different hypotheses of sample size and hypothetical numbers of
successful binomial events using the <B>-bi</B> option (see below).

<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><B>Minimum number of events to detect</B></STRONG></DT>
<DD>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
This is a variation over the previous design: prevalence is low and
the capacity to deal with a large sample often necessary to achieve a
reasonable precision of the measured estimate is limited. We will
rather want to detect with probability specified with <B>-level</B> at
least n sampled units with the studied characteristic, given a
probability of occurence = prevalence (<B>-pr</B>).  The option <B>  -nob</B> instructs sampsize to return the sample size needed to observe
at least <B>-nob</B> successful events, given a <B>-pr</B> probability
of occurence. Relevant options are:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>-nob</STRONG></DT>
<DD>number to observe
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>-pr</STRONG></DT>
<DD>prevalence: probability (%) of occurence of one event
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>-level</STRONG></DT>
<DD>probability of observing the given number of events

<P>

</DD>
<DT><STRONG><B>Binomial confidence intervals</B></STRONG></DT>
<DD>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The first design options may lead to small samples and the
approximations used to estimate sample size are known to be non valid
if less than 5 sampled units are expected to have the studied
characteristic (equally problemactic: all sampled units minus 5 or
less have that characteristic). One alternative approach is to
calculate the binomial exact confidence intervals that result from
different sets of numbers. Relevant options are:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>-bi</STRONG></DT>
<DD>two parameters: number of observations, number of successes
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>-level</STRONG></DT>
<DD>of confidence interval, default 95%

</DL>

<P>
<I>S</I>ampsize estimates the required sample size for studies
comparing two groups. <I>S</I>ampsize can be used when comparing
means or proportions for simple studies where only one measurement of
the outcome is planned.  <I>S</I>ampsize computes the sample size for
two-sample comparison of means, where the postulated values of the
means and standard deviations are <B>-means m1 m2 sd1 sd2</B>;
one-sample comparison of mean to hypothesized value (option <B>  -onesample</B> must be specified and only three parameters to the
option <B>-means</B> are allowed in one-sample tests: m1, m2 and sd1);
two-sample comparison of proportions (option <B>-cp</B> where the
postulated values of the proportions are #1 and #2); and one-sample
comparison of proportion to hypothesized value (option <B>  -onesample</B> should be specified), where the hypothesized proportion
(null hypothesis) is #1 and the postulated proportion (alternative
hypothesis) is #2. Default power is 90%. If <B>-n</B> is
specified, <I>s</I>ampsize will compute power.

<P>
In the case of a cluster sampling design, a sample of natural groups
of individuals is selected, rather than a random sample of the
individuals themselves. Observations are no longer independant as we
would expect had they been drawn randomly from the population.
Nonindependance is measured by the intraclass correlation, which is
specified with option <B>-rho</B> (between 0 and 1).  One may then
specify <B>-numclus</B>, the number of clusters (for instance, the
number of physicians who will recruit the patients: typically, the
intraclass orrelation will be fairly small, often between 0 and 0.05),
or alternatively, <B>-obsclus</B>, the minimum number of
observations per cluster. The larger the number of clusters and the
fewer observations per cluster, the less the effect on the standard
error estimates. A sample of 250 consisting of 50 clusters with 5
observations per cluster will have better power than the same sample
size consisting of 25 clusters with 10 observations per cluster. In
fact, with only one observation per cluster, we are back to a simple
random sample. If there is no intraclass correlation, there will be no
increase in the sample size estimate.

<P>
By default, no continuity correction is applied when computing sample
size or power for the comparison of two percentages. However, the
correction may be applied with option <B>-cc </B>.  The correction
will result in a greater sample size and smaller power. Simulations
showed that the correction is most often too conservative (Alzola C
and Harrell F, An introduction to S and the Hmisc and Design
Libraries: <TT><A NAME="tex2html2"

<DD>

</DL>

<P>
To specify a case-control design, we need to type the option <B>  -exp</B>, which specifies the percentage of exposed controls. If we add
the option <B>-or</B>, the odds-ratio that that we wish to detect,
<I>s</I>ampsize will return the sample size for an unmatched design
(option <B>-c</B> specifies the ratio of controls/cases, the default
ratio is 1). The option <B>-matched</B> may be used to specify a 1:1
matched study design (<B>-c</B> may not be used with <B>-matched</B>).
If we specify <B>-exp</B>, <B>-or</B>, and <B>-n</B>, <B>  sampsize</B> will return the power of the specified design. If one
specifies <B>-exp</B> and <B>-n</B>, which is the number of cases,
<I>s</I>ampsize will return the minimum detectable odds-ratio greater
than one and the maximum detectable odds-ratio lower than one, an
alternative to the power determination. Relevant options are:

</DD>
<DT><STRONG><B>Equivalence trials: sample size</B></STRONG></DT>
<DD>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The goal of an equivalence trial is to prove that two quantities are
equal. The hypothesis framework for an equivalence trial requires the
specification of no difference in the alternative and a difference in
the null. It contains an additional parameter delta, <B>-d</B>, to
indicate the maximum clinical difference allowed for an experimental
therapy to be considered equivalent with a standard therapy. Binomial
endpoints are defined as the positive difference of the probability of
success for the standard <I>group (ps)</I> and the probability of
success for the experimental <I>group (pt)</I> of patients. These
probabities are entered with <B>-cp #ps #pt</B> (percentages), and
delta is entered as a percentage. In the case of a continuous
endpoint, delta indicates the maximum clinical difference allowed for
the comparison of two means, and is entered using the <B>-d</B> option.
Means and standard deviations are to be entered the usual way with
<B>-means ms me ss se</B>, with ms and me the means in the standard and
experimental group, respectively, and ss and se the standard
deviations.

<P>
There is a general misconception that it requires a larger sample to
prove equivalence than difference. The veracity of this assumption is
situation-specific and dependant upon the degree of difference, delta,
one is willing to allow so that the standard and experimental
treatments may still be considered equivalent. Relevant options are:

<DD>Kessler and Clark (1978) studied 365 males with bladder
  cancer and an equal number of controls, 35 percent of whom reported
  past use of nonnutritive sweeteners. Using a one-sided test at the
  alpha = 5% level, the smallest relative risk greater than one that
  can be detected with 90% power is RR = 1.55:
